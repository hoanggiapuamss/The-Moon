            I’m an enthusiastic junior double majoring in CS and Mathematics,
            with concentrations in Backend and Statistics. I'm passionate about
            creating innovative and impactful solutions with technology, as I’ve
            gained hands-on valuable experience as a Software Engineer Intern at
            FPT Software, implementing Backend Spring-based API for an e-wallet.
            I am also passionate about financial topics, and that’s what our
            group will be working on for CS 326’s final project. I believe that
            with our enthusiasm, adaptability and teamwork, we will be able to
            deliver a quality project at the end of this course.

            With a background in web development that spans across
            HTML/CSS/JavaScript, REST API, MongoDB, ExpressJS. I strive to
            create responsive, user-friendly websites grounded in a robust
            understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Beyond these areas, I am
            deeply interested in emerging technologies such as blockchain, Web3
            development, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning
            (ML). For this project, my goal is to delve deeper into database
            servers and enhance data scraping techniques, particularly for
            financial news. This project is driven by my ambition to develop an
            all-encompassing finance website, designed to keep users informed
            about every facet of the finance world. I am eager to collaborate
            with finance enthusiasts and seasoned professionals on my team.
            Together, we aim to build a professional, end-to-end website project
            that is not only scalable but also stands as a testament to our
            collective expertise and vision.

      <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
      <p>
        This project is the culmination of knowledge gained from many aspects of
        our experience and education. Let’s start with the main theme, computer
        science, which is our major. This project synthesizes our knowledge of
        computer science that we’ve been accumulating during our time at college
        such as data structure, programming methodology, network protocols,
        algorithms,etc… The next aspect is finance,in which everyone knows that
        if you have knowledge about finance in general, you would have a huge
        advantage in investing and growing wealth and status. Starting this
        project means that each of us has to research to have some degree of
        understanding about the market in order to easily communicate with your
        teammates and speed up the work’s flow. This helps us practice
        self-studying and research habits as we all have to spend time and put
        effort into these topics despite that this is not our major. In a bigger
        picture, it helps us practice and encourages us to be outside of the
        box, to be more independent, flexible and adapt to different situations.
        During our coursework in college, some of us have an opportunity to take
        Junior Writing. In this class, we are taught about ethical computing
        practice. Therefore, In our project, we focus on inclusivity and safety
        for everyone. Our point is very clear. This is not a place for hate
        speech or any discriminatory content.
